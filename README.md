[Zdog] in [DrawBot]

*This was a fun weekend project. I wanted to understand how zDog worked, so I read the JavaScript source and translated it to Python in DrawBot. Some things work, others don’t (check out the demos).*

*I don’t know when and if I’ll ever have time to work on this again… Please fork & make it better!*
